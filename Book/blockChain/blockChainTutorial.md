Roadmap to Become a Blockchain Developer
The steps below include the exact steps to follow in order to get started with blockchain and become a blockchain developer. So, lets dive into these steps one by one −

Build a strong foundation of any programming language, syntax, object oriented programming (OOP) concepts and data structures, especially linked lists, graph and trees.
Master at least one programming language like Python, JavaScript, or Solidity, which form the crux of blockchain development.
Learn the core computer science subjects like Information and Network Security, Cryptography, Computer Networks and Database Management System (DBMS).
Brush up mathematics topics like Probability, Statistics, Linear Algebra and Calculus.
Start with Blockchain basics- Distributed Systems, Consensus Mechanisms (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake) ad Decentralized applications, called DApps.
Explore different blockchain categories like Public, Private, Hybrid and Consortium.
Master Smart Contracts and Solidity.
Study cryptographic concepts like hashing, encryption, digital signatures, and key management.
Choose a platform like Ethereum and its programming language Solidity. Practice writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
Explore the Ethereum Ecosystem like Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Start working on Web3 concepts in detail.
Create projects and participate in hackathons and competitions to hone your skills in Web3 and Solidity.
Explore more platforms apart from Ethereum, like Solana, Cordano and Polkadot and many more.
Contribute to Open Source community and gain practical exposure in the field. Open source areas include the GSoC (Google Summer of Code) and many more.

## key elements of blockchain
* distributed leger 
decentralized : meaning that no individual or group possesses authority over it.

* Immutable records
can’t alter or manipulate

* smart contracts
to speed transaction ，a set of rules . a smart contract defines conditions for corporate bond transfers
