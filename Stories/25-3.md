acknowledge the finiteness of life and understand that courage is a non-renewable resource . 
Do the things you truly want to do and pursue what you genuinely love deep in your heart.
As long as you think it is worthwhile ,there is no need to seek any one else's opinion.
At this moment , your ability to execute and your capabilities will come to you spontaneously.
The quickest way to change your destiny is to jump into the water ,endure choking on water ,
and keep going until you learn how to swim . And the younger you are when you go through this process,the better

capabilities 能力
